# Distributed File Storage Project - Analysis & Improvement Checklist

## Project Overview
This is a distributed file storage system built in Go that demonstrates peer-to-peer file sharing with encryption and replication. The system consists of multiple nodes that can store, replicate, and retrieve files across the network.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Core P2P Communication**: TCP-based transport layer with proper peer management
- **File Storage**: Content-addressable storage (CAS) with SHA1-based path transformation
- **Encryption**: AES encryption/decryption for file data with random keys and IVs
- **Replication**: Files are automatically replicated across connected peers
- **Network Bootstrap**: Nodes can connect to bootstrap nodes to join the network
- **File Retrieval**: Files can be fetched from remote peers when not available locally
- **Basic Testing**: Some unit tests for core functionality

### ❌ Current Issues & Limitations

#### 1. **Test Failures**
- [ ] **TCP Transport Test Failing**: Port binding issues in `p2p/tcp_transport_test.go`
  - Error: `listen tcp :3000: bind: address already in use`
  - Need to use dynamic ports or proper test cleanup

#### 2. **Error Handling & Resilience**
- [ ] **Poor Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the application
- [ ] **No Network Failure Recovery**: No retry mechanisms for failed network operations
- [ ] **No Graceful Degradation**: System doesn't handle partial failures well
- [ ] **No Connection Timeouts**: Network operations can hang indefinitely

#### 3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- [ ] **No Authentication**: Anyone can connect to any node
- [ ] **No Authorization**: No access control for file operations
- [ ] **Weak Key Management**: Encryption keys are generated randomly without proper exchange
- [ ] **No Secure Handshake**: Current handshake is a no-op (`NOPHandshakeFunc`)
- [ ] **No Data Integrity Verification**: No checksums or corruption detection

#### 4. **Operational & Management Issues**
- [ ] **No Configuration Management**: All settings are hardcoded
- [ ] **No Logging Framework**: Basic log statements without structured logging
- [ ] **No Metrics/Monitoring**: No visibility into system performance or health
- [ ] **No CLI Interface**: No way to interact with the system beyond the demo code
- [ ] **No REST API**: No HTTP interface for external applications

#### 5. **Scalability & Performance**
- [ ] **No Load Balancing**: Files are requested from all peers simultaneously
- [ ] **No Intelligent Placement**: No strategy for optimal file placement
- [ ] **No Connection Pooling**: New connections for each operation
- [ ] **No Compression**: Files are stored and transmitted without compression
- [ ] **No Caching**: No local caching of frequently accessed files

#### 6. **Data Management**
- [ ] **No Storage Limits**: No quota management or storage limits
- [ ] **No Garbage Collection**: Deleted files may leave orphaned data
- [ ] **No Data Deduplication**: Duplicate files consume extra storage
- [ ] **No Backup/Recovery**: No mechanisms for data backup or disaster recovery

#### 7. **Network & Discovery**
- [ ] **Manual Node Discovery**: Nodes must be manually configured with bootstrap addresses
- [ ] **No Dynamic Topology**: Network topology is static after initial connection
- [ ] **No Health Checks**: No mechanism to detect and handle failed nodes
- [ ] **No Network Partitioning Handling**: No support for network splits/merges

#### 8. **Development & Deployment**
- [ ] **Limited Test Coverage**: Missing integration tests, performance tests
- [ ] **No Documentation**: Minimal documentation for users and developers
- [ ] **No Containerization**: No Docker support for easy deployment
- [ ] **No CI/CD Pipeline**: No automated testing or deployment
