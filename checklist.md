# Distributed File Storage Project - Improvement Checklist

## Project Overview
This is a distributed file storage system built in Go that demonstrates peer-to-peer file sharing with encryption and replication. The system consists of multiple nodes that can store, replicate, and retrieve files across the network.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- **Core P2P Communication**: TCP-based transport layer with proper peer management
- **File Storage**: Content-addressable storage (CAS) with SHA1-based path transformation
- **Encryption**: AES encryption/decryption for file data with random keys and IVs
- **Replication**: Files are automatically replicated across connected peers
- **Network Bootstrap**: Nodes can connect to bootstrap nodes to join the network
- **File Retrieval**: Files can be fetched from remote peers when not available locally
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration test coverage (25+ tests)
- **Structured Logging**: Multi-level logging with contextual information
- **Configuration Management**: JSON config, environment variables, CLI flags
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Custom error types with intelligent retry logic
- **CLI Interface**: Full-featured command-line tool for system interaction
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### ðŸ”„ Current Issues & Future Enhancements

#### 1. **Security & Authentication**
- [ ] **No Authentication**: Anyone can connect to any node
- [ ] **No Authorization**: No access control for file operations
- [ ] **Weak Key Management**: Encryption keys are generated randomly without proper exchange
- [ ] **No Secure Handshake**: Current handshake is a no-op (`NOPHandshakeFunc`)
- [ ] **No Data Integrity Verification**: No checksums or corruption detection
- [ ] **No TLS Support**: Communication is not encrypted in transit

#### 2. **API & Integration**
- [ ] **No REST API**: No HTTP interface for external applications
- [ ] **No WebSocket Support**: No real-time communication capabilities
- [ ] **No gRPC Interface**: No high-performance RPC interface

#### 3. **Monitoring & Observability**
- [ ] **No Metrics/Monitoring**: No visibility into system performance or health
- [ ] **No Health Checks**: No endpoint for system health verification
- [ ] **No Distributed Tracing**: No request tracing across nodes
- [ ] **No Performance Profiling**: No built-in profiling capabilities

#### 4. **Scalability & Performance**
- [ ] **No Load Balancing**: Files are requested from all peers simultaneously
- [ ] **No Intelligent Placement**: No strategy for optimal file placement
- [ ] **No Connection Pooling**: New connections for each operation
- [ ] **No Compression**: Files are stored and transmitted without compression
- [ ] **No Caching**: No local caching of frequently accessed files
- [ ] **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse or overload

#### 5. **Data Management**
- [ ] **No Storage Limits**: No quota management or storage limits
- [ ] **No Garbage Collection**: Deleted files may leave orphaned data
- [ ] **No Data Deduplication**: Duplicate files consume extra storage
- [ ] **No Backup/Recovery**: No mechanisms for data backup or disaster recovery
- [ ] **No File Versioning**: No support for file version history
- [ ] **No Metadata Management**: Limited file metadata support

#### 6. **Network & Discovery**
- [ ] **Manual Node Discovery**: Nodes must be manually configured with bootstrap addresses
- [ ] **No Dynamic Topology**: Network topology is static after initial connection
- [ ] **No Node Health Monitoring**: No mechanism to detect and handle failed nodes
- [ ] **No Network Partitioning Handling**: No support for network splits/merges
- [ ] **No Peer Reputation System**: No mechanism to track peer reliability
- [ ] **No Network Optimization**: No bandwidth or latency optimization

#### 7. **Development & Deployment**
- [ ] **No Documentation Website**: Missing comprehensive documentation
- [ ] **No Containerization**: No Docker support for easy deployment
- [ ] **No CI/CD Pipeline**: No automated testing or deployment
- [ ] **No Kubernetes Support**: No orchestration manifests
- [ ] **No Helm Charts**: No package management for Kubernetes
- [ ] **No Monitoring Dashboards**: No pre-built monitoring solutions
